# Shooter-PRO
Shooter Pro is basically a 2D shooting game that is based in a nebula space environment. In the game, we can control the motion of the playable character/ship in the XY plane. 

* Now in order to make a game, we must have a basic understanding of the environment in which the game is made.
* Two things that are the really important to get started with, is a Game Engine and a scripting code language.

* Game Engine: Unity
* Scripted in C#.

* There are scripts that are attached to each material to function in a particular way. For example, Player, Enemy, Laser, Score sheet etc.Sprites are used to get a better graphical representation of these game objects. The re occuring game objects are considered to be prefabs which arrive according to the conditions specified by the if-else statements.
